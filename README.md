# DOOM game recreated from scratch using only Python

This is a fan project in which I followed the tutorial provided by XXX and did the code along as training exercise.

While it was a lot of fun doing this, the intention of this game being pushed is only for studies. 

The owner of the code is XXX.

Just download it and have fun!

Note: In order to install PyGame, remember to install the legacy version 3.10 as it hasn't been updated to the new Python version.
